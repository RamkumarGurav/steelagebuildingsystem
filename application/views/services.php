        <div class="sub_divider"></div>
        <p class="paraservc2">Pre Engineered Steel Buildings (PEB) revolutionized the construction market using
          built-ups in place of conventional Hot Rolled Sections. PEB is a steel structure built over a structural
          concept of primary members, secondary members, and the cover sheeting connected to each other. The structural
          members are custom designed to be lighter in weight as well as high in strength. Pre-Engineered Steel
          Buildings can be fitted with different structural additions like trusses, mezzanine floors, fascias, canopies
          and crane systems as per user requirements.</p>
        <p class="paraservc2">

          Pre-engineered buildings are ideal for use in non residential, wide span low rise buildings. Among the
          advantages of PEB is consistent quality control, and fast delivery to name a few. PEB buildings are used for
          diverse applications such as factories, warehouses, offices, shopping malls, schools, hospitals, community
          buildings and several more.
